### 📊 **Progress Display Features**

### 🎯 **User Experience Benefits**

### 🌐 **How It Works**

4. **Completion**: Final step shows success message and next actions

### 📁 **Files Enhanced**

**Test it by:**

This provides a much more professional and user-friendly experience compared to the simple "Processing..." message that was there before!
